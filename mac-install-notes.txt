build/install cavass
--------------------
Note: gcc --version
      shows that gcc on the mac is clang.

Obtain wxWidgets source code. Then:
  tar xjf ~/Downloads/wxWidgets-3.2.7.tar.bz2 
  mkdir wx-build
  cd wx-build
  ../wxWidgets-3.2.7/configure --with-png=no --enable-svg=no
  make

(optional) Obtain ITK source code.
  last seen at https://itk.org/download/
  tar xvf ~/Downloads/InsightToolkit-5.3.0.tar
  mkdir itk-build
  run cmake gui

Obtain cavass source code.
  git clone https://github.com/MedicalImageProcessingGroup/cavass.git
  mkdir cavass-build
  run cmake gui
    source code:       /Users/ggrevera/monday/cavass
    binaries:          /Users/ggrevera/monday/cavass-build
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:  Debug or Release
    ITK_DIR:           (optionally specify location)
    wxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE:  /Users/ggrevera/monday/wx-build/wx-config
    wxWidgets_wxrc_EXECUTABLE:  /Users/ggrevera/monday/wx-build/utils/wxrc/wxrc

Edit (create, if necessary) ~/.zshrc. Add the following lines to the end:
  export VIEWNIX_ENV=~/cavass-build
  #the export below is necessary to run cavass w/ an icon
  export PATH=$PATH:~/cavass-build/cavass.app/Contents/MacOS
  export PATH=$PATH:~/cavass-build
  export WXSUPPRESS_SIZER_FLAGS_CHECK=1
Open a new terminal window for these changes to take effect.

cavass & git (source code repository)
-------------------------------------
Note: All git commands (except clone) must be in CAVASS source dir.
Useful git commands:
  1. obtain a complete copy of CAVASS (from a remote repository)
       git clone https://github.com/MedicalImageProcessingGroup/cavass.git
  2. list my changes
       git status
  3. add my changes to the staging area
       git add *
  4. commit my changes (in the staging area) to my local repo
       git commit -m "my notes that will be added to these changes"
         or
       git commit -F ../notes.txt  (<-- notes.txt NOT in cavass source dir)
  5. update my copy with updates in the remote repo:
       git pull
  6. push my changes to the remote repo:
       git push -u origin master

My personal/suggested workflow:
  A. I start working in the morning and do the following:
       git pull
     to update my code with any changes in the remote repo.

  B. I change the source code.

  C. Do
       make
     in cavass-build, and test my changes.

  D. At the end of the day, I do the following:
     1. update my code with any updates in the remote repo:
          git pull
     2. All conflicts MUST be resolved before the remote repo is updated.
     3. Do
          make
        to rebuild my code.
     4. Test my code again.
     5. Update the remote with my changes:
          git push -u origin master
  Note: One may repeat this throughout the day as often as one wishes.
--------------------
cavass and clion ide
--------------------
1. Build cavass as per above.
2. Open cavass-build as a makefile (not cmake) project.
3. Clean and rebuild all of cavass.
4. To debug cavass using the clion, you must tell clion where it is.
   Select cavass from the menu between the hammer and run and debug icons.
   Select cavass --> > --> Edit... and specify executable (e.g.,
   ~/monday/cavass-build/cavass.app/Contents/MacOS/cavass).
5. Source code appears in Project --> External Sources.
   main.cpp is where cavass starts (in CavassMain::OnInit()).

Note: cavass --> > --> Run 'cavass' with Valgring Memcheck is available
   (but needs to be installed).
