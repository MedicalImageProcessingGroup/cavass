We are primarily using CAVASS under Ubuntu Linux.  Here are the steps we 
follow to install it.  The procedure will most likely be somewhat different 
on other Linux/Unix systems.

You need to install Gnome development software and cmake.
  Under Ubuntu:
  sudo apt install libgtk2.0-dev

  Under OpenSUSE:
  Use the Software Management tool. You can find it in the Control Center 
  (YaST).  Search for gtk2-devel.  Check the box and apply the change.  The 
  rest of the Gnome development software (cc, c++, make), if it doesn't come 
  with gtk2-devel.

You also need to install wxWidgets:
go to wxwidgets.org, download wxWidgets-3.0.5.tar.bz2,
tar xjf wxWidgets-3.0.5.tar.bz2
cd wxWidgets-3.0.5
mkdir buildgtk
cd buildgtk
../configure --with-gtk
make
[wait]
sudo make install
[enter password]
sudo /sbin/ldconfig

You may optionally install ITK:
go to http://www.itk.org/ITK/resources/software.html, download InsightToolkit-5.1.2.tar.gz,
mkdir itk
cd itk
ccmake ../InsightToolkit-5.1.2
c [configure]
go down to BUILD_TESTING, if OFF enter to turn ON
c [configure]
e [exit help]
g [generate and exit]
make
[wait]

Then you install CAVASS:
tar xzf cavass-src-1_0_29.tgz
mkdir cavass-build
cd cavass-build
ccmake ../cavass
c [configure]
e [exit help, if no ITK]
go down to CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, enter, type "Release", enter
c [configure]
e [exit help, if no ITK]
g [generate and exit]
make
[wait]
in /etc/profile.local put the commands:

VIEWNIX_ENV=~/cavass-build
PATH=$PATH:~/cavass-build
export PATH VIEWNIX_ENV

but instead of ~ put the directory where cavass-build is.  Those commands will 
take effect on your next login.

You may have to change your appearance settings for GTK2 applications to make
the button labels readable.
