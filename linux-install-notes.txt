We are primarily using CAVASS under Ubuntu Linux.  Here are the steps we 
follow to install it.  The procedure will most likely be somewhat different 
on other Linux/Unix systems.

You need to install Gnome development software and cmake.
  Under Ubuntu:
    sudo apt install libgtk2.0-dev
    sudo apt install cmake

  Under OpenSUSE:
    Use the Software Management tool. You can find it in the Control Center 
    (YaST).  Search for gtk2-devel.  Check the box and apply the change.  The 
    rest of the Gnome development software (cc, c++, make), if it doesn't come 
    with gtk2-devel.

You also need to install wxWidgets:
  go to wxwidgets.org, download wxWidgets-3.2.2.1.tar.bz2,
  tar xjf wxWidgets-3.2.2.1.tar.bz2
  cd wxWidgets-3.2.2.1
  mkdir buildgtk
  cd buildgtk
  ../configure --with-gtk
  make
  [wait]
  sudo make install
  [enter password]
  sudo /sbin/ldconfig

You may optionally install ITK:
  go to http://www.itk.org/ITK/resources/software.html, download InsightToolkit-5.3.0.tar.gz,
  mkdir itk
  cd itk
  ccmake ../InsightToolkit-5.3.0
  c [configure]
  go down to BUILD_TESTING, if OFF enter to turn ON
  c [configure]
  e [exit help]
  g [generate and exit]
  make
  [wait]

Then you install CAVASS:
  git clone https://github.com/MedicalImageProcessingGroup/cavass.git
  mkdir cavass-build
  cd cavass-build
  ccmake ../cavass
  c [configure]
  e [exit help]
  go down to CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, press "enter", type "Release", press "enter"
  optionally go down to ITK_DIR, press "enter", type "../itk-build", press "enter"
  go down to wxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE, press "enter", type "../wxWidgets-3.2.2.1/buildgtk/wx-config, press "enter"
  go down to wxWidgets_wxrc/EXECUTABLE, press "enter", type "../wxWidgets-3.2.2.1/buildgtk/utils/wxrc/wxrc", press "enter"
  c [configure]
  g [generate and exit]
  make
  [wait]

in /etc/profile.local put the commands:
  VIEWNIX_ENV=~/cavass-build
  PATH=$PATH:~/cavass-build
  export PATH VIEWNIX_ENV
    but instead of ~ put the directory where cavass-build is.  Those commands
    will take effect on your next login.

You may have to change your appearance settings for GTK2 applications to make
the button labels readable.

How to create a desktop icon:
  Copy the file, cavass.desktop, to the desktop folder.
  Edit cavass.desktop and specify the correct paths to cavass and the png file.
